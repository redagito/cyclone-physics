	/**
	 * The contact resolution routine. One resolver instance
	 * can be shared for the whole simulation, as long as you need
	 * roughly the same parameters each time (which is normal).
	 *
	 * @section algorithm Resolution Algorithm
	 *
	 * The resolver uses an iterative satisfaction algorithm; it loops
	 * through each contact and tries to resolve it. Each contact is
	 * resolved locally, which may in turn put other contacts in a worse
	 * position. The algorithm then revisits other contacts and repeats
	 * the process up to a specified iteration limit. It can be proved
	 * that given enough iterations, the simulation will get to the
	 * correct result. As with all approaches, numerical stability can
	 * cause problems that make a correct resolution impossible.
	 *
	 * @subsection strengths Strengths
	 *
	 * This algorithm is very fast, much faster than other physics
	 * approaches. Even using many more iterations than there are
	 * contacts, it will be faster than global approaches.
	 *
	 * Many global algorithms are unstable under high friction, this
	 * approach is very robust indeed for high friction and low
	 * restitution values.
	 *
	 * The algorithm produces visually believable behaviour. Tradeoffs
	 * have been made to err on the side of visual realism rather than
	 * computational expense or numerical accuracy.
	 *
	 * @subsection weaknesses Weaknesses
	 *
	 * The algorithm does not cope well with situations with many
	 * inter-related contacts: stacked boxes, for example. In this
	 * case the simulation may appear to jiggle slightly, which often
	 * dislodges a box from the stack, allowing it to collapse.
	 *
	 * Another issue with the resolution mechanism is that resolving
	 * one contact may make another contact move sideways against
	 * friction, because each contact is handled independently, this
	 * friction is not taken into account. If one object is pushing
	 * against another, the pushed object may move across its support
	 * without friction, even though friction is set between those bodies.
	 *
	 * In general this resolver is not suitable for stacks of bodies,
	 * but is perfect for handling impact, explosive, and flat resting
	 * situations.
